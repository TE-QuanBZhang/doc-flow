# Android ANR Investigator

## Purpose
Use this skill for:
- ANR reports
- app freeze complaints
- "click does nothing"
- long startup hangs
- blocked navigation
- jank severe enough to appear frozen

## Goals
- Identify what the main thread was blocked on
- Distinguish CPU-heavy work from I/O wait or lock contention
- Find the responsible code path
- Propose targeted fixes with low regression risk
- Suggest observability and performance regression checks

## Inputs
Useful inputs include:
- ANR traces
- main thread stack
- all-thread dump
- reproduction steps
- startup flow details
- logs around freeze time
- related source files
- performance traces (Perfetto / systrace) if available

## Workflow

### 1. Identify ANR type
Determine whether it is likely:
- input dispatch timeout
- broadcast receiver timeout
- service timeout
- startup hang
- background-to-foreground resume hang
- render stall / long frame burst

### 2. Inspect main thread state
Find whether the main thread is:
- running CPU-heavy work
- waiting on a monitor/lock
- blocked on binder
- blocked on disk I/O
- blocked on network
- blocked on `Future`, `CountDownLatch`, `join`, or `runBlocking`
- doing expensive layout/measure/draw work

### 3. Correlate with app code
Locate:
- first app-owned frame on main thread
- caller chain
- related worker thread if main thread is waiting
- lock owner if contention is visible

### 4. Classify root cause
Common classes:
- synchronous disk read/write on main thread
- database access on main thread
- blocking IPC/binder call
- image decode on main thread
- expensive JSON parsing
- startup dependency chain too long
- deadlock or lock contention
- misuse of coroutines (`runBlocking`, bad dispatcher choice)
- RecyclerView / Compose overwork
- repeated invalidation or render loop

### 5. Recommend fix
Prefer:
- moving work off main thread
- reducing startup critical path
- precomputing or caching expensive work
- replacing blocking waits with async flow
- reducing lock scope
- using structured concurrency properly
- incremental rendering or lazy loading

Avoid:
- arbitrary thread sleeps
- masking ANR by delaying UI work without fixing dependency chain
- adding retries on main thread
- overusing global scopes

### 6. Define validation
Provide:
- how to measure before/after
- what traces/logging to capture
- scenarios to retest on low-end devices
- startup, resume, navigation, and rotation checks

## Output Format
1. **ANR Summary**
2. **Main Thread Blocker**
3. **Likely Root Cause**
4. **Suspect Files / Call Paths**
5. **Recommended Fix**
6. **Performance Validation**
7. **Regression Risks**

## Heuristics
- Treat `runBlocking` on main thread as a strong smell.
- Treat Room/database access on main thread as a high-priority suspect.
- If main thread waits on a lock, inspect the lock holder and lock scope.
- If startup is slow, separate must-have initialization from deferrable initialization.
- If UI rendering is expensive, inspect repeated binds, deep nesting, and recomposition churn.

## Good Fix Patterns
- switch to `Dispatchers.IO` for disk/database
- replace blocking call with suspend API
- defer noncritical initialization
- reduce synchronized region
- cache parsed/config objects
- paginate or lazy-render large lists

## Anti-Patterns
- suppressing ANR symptoms with loading spinners alone
- moving everything to background without lifecycle ownership
- increasing timeouts without analysis
- keeping startup "synchronous for simplicity"

## CodeGraph Integration

CodeGraph helps identify the blocking call and its call chain during ANR investigation.

**When to run CodeGraph**:
- During step 2 (inspect main thread state) — locate the blocking method in the source tree
- During step 3 (correlate with app code) — find all callers and the async/dispatcher context
- During step 4 (classify root cause) — understand the full call chain leading to the block

```bash
codegraph explore "<suspected blocking class or method>"
```

**What to look for from CodeGraph results**:
- **Callers on main thread**: who invokes the blocking method from the UI thread
- **Async dispatchers**: whether the work runs on `Dispatchers.IO`, `Dispatchers.Main`, or a custom dispatcher
- **Lock contention**: static locks, shared resources, synchronized blocks in the call chain
- **Binder call sites**: AIDL/IPC calls that may block the main thread
- **Disk/network access**: file I/O, database queries, network requests visible in the call graph

**Scope note**: CodeGraph does not reliably index `AndroidManifest.xml` (broadcast receivers, services) or Gradle build scripts. For ANRs involving manifest-declared components or dependency version mismatches, supplement with `rg`/`find`.

**Fallback**: If `codegraph explore` returns no meaningful results, proceed without it — CodeGraph is an enhancement, not a blocker. Fall back to `rg`/grep for manual blocking-call search.
